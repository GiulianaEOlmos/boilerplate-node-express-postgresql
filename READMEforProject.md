## {{Project Title}}

### Introduction

{Briefly introduce the project, explaining what it does and which technologies are used. For example, mention if it's built with TypeScript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, etc.}

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

### Running the Project with Docker Compose

Using Docker Compose will allow you to run the server and database locally. Follow these steps:

1. **Build the containers:**:

   ```sh
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start the containers**:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Stop Docker Compose**:

   a. **Without removing volumes (to keep your data)**:

   ```sh
    docker-compose down
   ```

   b. **With volume removal (deletes the database data)**:

   ```sh
    docker-compose down -v
   ```
